        Jumped all versions of library, script and package up to 0.10
        so that they all match.
        (Previously the script version was left at 0.01, in error).

        Added "locatedb" as synonym for "database" option.

        Shut-off some debug messages.  Added internal DEBUG options
        turned on by the existing -D script option.
