App-Relate version 0.01
=======================

Implements the functionality for the L<relate> script, which uses
the system's "locate" database to find file names that match
multiple search terms.

This version uses the List::Filter modules to get some
flexibility and persistance advantages.

It tries to access the locate database through File::Locate::Harder
in order to be relatively portable.
